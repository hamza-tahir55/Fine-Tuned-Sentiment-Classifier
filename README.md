## Overview
This project fine-tunes the **DistilBERT** model using the Hugging Face `transformers` library on the IMDB dataset for binary sentiment classification. The model is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for deployment in production environments.

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-imdb.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-imdb
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

### Training
To fine-tune the DistilBERT model on the IMDB dataset, run the training script:
```bash
python train.py
```
- The training script uses the Hugging Face `Trainer` API.
- The fine-tuned model and tokenizer will be saved in the `model/` and `tokenizer/` directories, respectively.

### Inference
To use the fine-tuned model for sentiment analysis, run the inference script:
```bash
python predict.py --text "This movie was fantastic!"
```
- The script will output the predicted sentiment (positive or negative).

---

## Model Performance
The fine-tuned model achieves the following performance on the IMDB test set:
- **Accuracy**: ~92%
- **F1 Score**: ~92%

---

## Dataset
The IMDB dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews) or use the Hugging Face `datasets` library to load it:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("imdb")
```
